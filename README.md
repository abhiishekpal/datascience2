## Server Folder
The Server has been implemented using Flask. <br />
Redis has been used as a database to hold store our input data as 'key-value' pair.

Before starting our model server start the Redis Server by entering: redis-server. <br />
Now start the Server by entering: python server-side.py

## Client Folder
My actual html file to be run is predict.html <br />
The script as of now accepts jpg format image.
